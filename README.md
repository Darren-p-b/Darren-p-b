<h1 align="center">Hello there! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif"/> I'm Darren</h1>

<h2 align="center">About Me</h2> 
<div>
  Junior Full-Stack Developer and recent graduate from School of Code (BC14)!
<br><br>
Previously working as a Virtual Receptionist at an Entertainment Company (Escape Rooms / Arcade Pub) I had the opportunity of performing a QA role not part of my formal duties. With every update cycle, there was always something new broken! Products unavailable, rescheduling bookings displaying incorrect metadata on both professional and user ends, products not exchanging correctly, calendar blocks out the wazoo! And perhaps my "favorite" - payment links cancelling bookings. All this and more! 
<br><br>
After finding my first workaround solution using my trusted companion Salesforce, I actively enjoyed finding new problems, documenting them, experimenting to find a solution, have my eureka moment and then distribute my solution to my team followed by an extensive bug report with detailed addendums to support what I'd found. Fast forward about 6-8 months, a morning before a shift lying in bed asking myself what I'm doing - I knew I wanted more of the problem solving and less of the customer service role. I enrolled on the competitive School of Code Bootcamp and got through thousands of applications - to which here I am now on the otherside to see how I might be able to fix these problems instead!
