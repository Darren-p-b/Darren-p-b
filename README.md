- âš¡ Fun fact: The big motivation for me to learn how to code was finding errors at my last workplace with our booking system and using Salesforce to make workarounds whilst the developers worked on solutions. Well why can't I be doing that I thought, I'm already making solutions whilst the real ones are on their way! :D
